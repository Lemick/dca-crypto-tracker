# DCA Crypto Tracker

A simple client-only web application for tracking your crypto investments. Can be seen here: https://dca-crypto-tracker.netlify.app/invest.

No information about the assets (persisted in local storage) is exchanged on the network.

The current features are:
- Add/Remove invests from the local DB
- Import invests from a Binance export CSV
- Filtering the invest table by coin
